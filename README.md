Embedded System

This project includes sensor, GUI, communication, and motor implementation.
The program mimics Pokemon game (Yellow version). There are two rovers being used.
first rover will behave as a trainer and is controlled by a XBox controller.
second rover follows the first rover.

GUI should be updated as rovers move.
